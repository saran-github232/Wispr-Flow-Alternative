# FlowSpeak

![FlowSpeak Dashboard](docs/app_screenshot.png)
A **local-first, cross-platform voice dictation app** — hold a key, speak, and clean text lands wherever your cursor is. Speech is transcribed on-device with Whisper and cleaned up (filler removal, self-corrections, punctuation, lists/newlines) by a local LLM, with an optional cloud path. It re-creates the workflow of a Wispr-Flow-style dictation tool from scratch, with its own name, palette, and code.

> ⚠️ **This is a proof of concept, vibe-coded in a few hours.** It works and the core loop is real, but it is rough and needs a lot of polish, testing, and hardening before it's anything like production quality. Treat it as a starting point, not a finished product.

## Platform status

| Platform | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **macOS 14+** | **Built and working** — developed and tested locally (Apple Silicon). |
| **Windows 10/11** | **Built and working** — compiles and runs on real Windows 11 (MSVC). Push-to-talk (hold **Right Ctrl**), Whisper ASR, clipboard+`SendInput` paste, and cloud cleanup (OpenAI or any OpenAI-compatible API, e.g. OpenRouter) are verified end-to-end. Auto-learn dictionary capture is still macOS-only; the local (on-device) LLM cleanup worker builds but is CPU-only for now (no CUDA/Vulkan yet). |

Both platforms are build-from-source only for now — there's no signed installer/release pipeline yet, so `git clone` + the steps below is the way to run it on either OS.

## What's in it

- **On-device ASR** — Whisper (via `whisper.cpp`), running on the GPU. Ships a small English model by default; larger models are auto-preferred if present.
- **Local LLM cleanup** — Qwen3-4B-Instruct (via `llama.cpp`) runs as a separate worker process and cleans the transcript: removes fillers, resolves spoken self-corrections ("meet at 2… no wait, 3" → "3"), applies spoken punctuation, and formats lists/paragraphs. Deterministic gates guard against over-editing, with a raw-transcript fallback.
- **Optional cloud cleanup** — OpenAI (default) / Anthropic, behind one trait. Keys are stored in the OS keychain (macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager), **never in a file**.
- **Floating pill UI** — a small always-on-top bar showing idle / recording / processing states.
- **Personal dictionary + auto-learn** — teach it names and terms; on macOS a post-paste Accessibility observer watches for a one-word correction and learns it automatically (conservative filters to avoid junk). *Auto-learn capture is macOS-only so far.*
- **Usage stats** — words dictated, words-per-minute, day streak, time saved, 7-day activity, all stored locally.

## Architecture

Tauri v2 (Rust core + React/TypeScript webviews). Platform-agnostic logic lives in `crates/flowspeak-core` (state machine, cleanup prompts/gates, dictionary, stats). ASR, audio, and the LLM worker are separate crates. The Tauri app in `src-tauri/` hosts the UI and wires the native hotkey/injection per platform (`hotkey.rs` on macOS, `win.rs` on Windows).

```
crates/
  flowspeak-core/       state machine, cleanup (prompts/gates/levels), dictionary, stats
  flowspeak-asr/        Whisper ASR
  flowspeak-audio/      mic capture + resampling
  flowspeak-cleanup/    OpenAI / Anthropic cloud providers
  flowspeak-llm-worker/ local llama.cpp cleanup worker (separate process)
src-tauri/           Tauri shell: hotkey/paste/autolearn (macOS), win.rs (Windows)
ui/                  React Hub + overlay pill
docs/                spec, architecture notes, research
```

## Build (macOS)

Requires Rust (stable), Node + pnpm, and the Xcode command-line tools.

```bash
cd ui && pnpm install && cd ..
# If pnpm reports [ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS] (esbuild's postinstall was
# skipped), this is a one-time, harmless-if-not-needed insurance step:
pnpm --dir ui approve-builds --all
# Dev:
./dev.sh
# Or a signed .app bundle — build ONLY via `tauri build`; a bare `cargo
# build` + manual codesign will NOT bundle the UI and can drop TCC grants:
ui/node_modules/.bin/tauri build --bundles app
```

Models are **not** committed (they're multi-GB) — see **[docs/MODELS.md](docs/MODELS.md)**
for the exact file + download link (short version: `ggml-base.en.bin` is
required, a Qwen GGUF for local/offline cleanup is optional).

## Build (Windows)

Requires Rust (stable, MSVC toolchain), [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/), the
**Visual Studio Build Tools** (Desktop development with C++ workload), Node + pnpm,
and **LLVM 18.1.x specifically** (not "latest" — see
**[docs/BUILD-PREREQUISITES.md](docs/BUILD-PREREQUISITES.md)**, this is the #1
first-build failure on Windows). Verify your toolchain before building:

```powershell
node scripts/check-build-prereqs.mjs
```

```powershell
cd ui; pnpm install; cd ..
# If pnpm reports [ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS] (esbuild's postinstall was
# skipped), this is a one-time, harmless-if-not-needed insurance step:
pnpm --dir ui approve-builds --all
# Dev (starts the Vite UI server + the app with hot reload):
ui\node_modules\.bin\tauri.CMD dev
# Or a release build — this produces an NSIS installer (.exe) on Windows:
ui\node_modules\.bin\tauri.CMD build
```

Place models under `%APPDATA%\FlowSpeak\models\` — see
**[docs/MODELS.md](docs/MODELS.md)** for the exact file + download link
(short version: `ggml-base.en.bin` is required, a Qwen GGUF for local/offline
cleanup is optional). No local LLM model?
Set Cleanup Engine to **OpenAI** in the Hub's Settings pane and point the base URL at
any OpenAI-compatible API — for example `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` for
[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai), with your OpenRouter key pasted into the
"OpenAI API key" field.

Push-to-talk defaults to **Right Ctrl** (hold to record, release to paste) — the
Windows analogue of Wispr Flow's own `Ctrl+Win` default; a configurable hotkey is
planned but not wired up yet.

The Windows GPU backend for Whisper/llama.cpp is CPU-only for now (the macOS build
uses Metal); CUDA/Vulkan feature flags can be added in `crates/flowspeak-asr/Cargo.toml`
and `crates/flowspeak-llm-worker/Cargo.toml` for anyone wanting to pick that up.

## Troubleshooting: "I hold the key, speak, and nothing gets typed"

FlowSpeak now surfaces the exact reason on the pill and in the Hub instead of
failing silently (previously this only ever logged to a terminal, which is
why it looked like nothing was happening at all). If you still hit this:

- **macOS — Accessibility.** This is the #1 cause. Open **System Settings →
  Privacy & Security → Accessibility** and confirm FlowSpeak is toggled ON.
  The Hub's onboarding screen blocks you here on first launch; if you granted
  it once and it still doesn't work, especially after **rebuilding** the app,
  see the next point.
- **macOS — "granted but still nothing" after a rebuild.** Every local
  `tauri build` produces a differently-signed binary, and macOS can leave a
  stale Accessibility entry for the old signature that *looks* granted but
  isn't. Fix: in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility, remove
  FlowSpeak with the **−** button and re-add it (or toggle it off/on), then
  relaunch. FlowSpeak's pill and Hub will now show "Fn key isn't wired up"
  when this happens instead of just doing nothing.
- **Windows — Right Ctrl does nothing.** Another app may be holding a
  conflicting global keyboard hook (some anti-cheat/security tools do this);
  close it and relaunch FlowSpeak.
- **No speech model.** See [docs/MODELS.md](docs/MODELS.md) — dictation needs
  a Whisper `ggml-*.bin` file placed by hand; the app doesn't download one for
  you.
- Still stuck? Run the app from a terminal (`./dev.sh` on macOS, or the built
  `.exe` from PowerShell on Windows) and hold the key once — every failure
  path also logs a `[flowspeak]`-prefixed line explaining what happened.

## Notes & disclaimers

- **Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Wispr Flow or any other product.** FlowSpeak is an independent, from-scratch reimplementation of the dictation workflow, with its own name, branding, colors, strings, and code. No third-party code or assets are included.
- **Proof of concept.** Rushed, under-tested, and missing plenty (auto-learn is macOS-only and conservative, no installer/notarization/signing pipeline on either OS, error handling is thin). Contributions and fixes welcome.
- **Privacy.** ASR and default cleanup run on-device. Cloud cleanup is opt-in and only sends the transcript (not audio) to the provider you choose. API keys never touch disk in plaintext.
