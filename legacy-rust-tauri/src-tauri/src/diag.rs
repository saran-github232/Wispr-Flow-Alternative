//! Bridge from `flowspeak_core::diagnostics` to the UI.
//!
//! Turns an [`InjectionFailure`] into a loud, visible signal instead of the
//! `eprintln!`-only diagnostics the dictation loop used to have: the flow bar
//! pill switches to its `error` state and lingers long enough to read, every
//! window gets a `flowspeak://error` broadcast, and the message is remembered so
//! the Hub can show it via [`last_error`] even if a window wasn't open (or
//! wasn't listening) at the moment it happened.
