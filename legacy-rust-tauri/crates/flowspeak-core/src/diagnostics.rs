//! User-facing diagnostics for injection/permission failures.
//!
//! Before this module existed, every way the dictation loop could fail to
//! deliver text — a missing macOS Accessibility grant, a stale TCC entry left
//! by an earlier build, a failed Windows keyboard hook, silence from the mic,
//! an empty transcript — only ever reached an `eprintln!`. That is invisible
//! to anyone who launched the packaged app by double-clicking it rather than
//! from a terminal, which is the default way a built app is used. Two
//! separate bug reports ("text is not writing where the cursor is") trace
//! back to exactly this: the failure was real and even correctly diagnosed in
//! the code, it just never reached the user.
//!
//! This module turns each distinct failure into a short, specific,
//! actionable [`Diagnostic`] the UI can show (see `flowspeak://error` /
//! `flowspeak://flowbar/state` in `src-tauri/src/diag.rs`), instead of a mystery
//! "nothing happened".

/// A distinct, identifiable reason the dictation loop failed to deliver text,
/// ordered roughly by how early in the pipeline it can occur.
